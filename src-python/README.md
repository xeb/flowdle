Flowdle
================
Flowdle is a task-tracking application originally built with Python on Google's App Engine in 2008.  It has laid dormant for a surperior technology to rise up & take its place.

This directory contains an updated version of Flowdle that uses High Replication and not Master/Slave (which the 2008 version used)
